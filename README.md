# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Introduction

This project aims to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It includes a Python-based backend for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction, as well as an HTML-based frontend for user interaction.

## Features

- Preprocess historical stock market data.
- Train an LSTM model on the preprocessed data.
- Make stock price predictions using the trained model.
- Web interface for uploading data and viewing predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Python Libraries

Install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow flask matplotlib
```

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

```
project_root/
├── app.py
├── data/
│   └── (place your CSV files here)
├── models/
│   └── (trained models will be saved here)
├── templates/
│   └── index.html
├── static/
│   └── (static files like CSS and JS)
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare the Data

Place your historical stock market data in the `data/` directory. Ensure the data is in CSV format with columns for date, open, high, low, close, and volume.

### 4. Train the Model

Run the following command to train the LSTM model on your data:

```
python train.py
```

This will preprocess the data, train the model, and save the trained model to the `models/` directory.

### 5. Run the Web Application

Start the Flask web application using the following command:

```
python app.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the application.

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. **Upload Data**: Use the upload form on the web interface to upload your CSV file containing historical stock market data.
2. **View Predictions**: Once the file is uploaded, the application will preprocess the data, make predictions using the trained LSTM model, and display the predicted stock prices.

### Example CSV Format

Ensure your CSV file has the following columns:

```
Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
2023-01-01, 100.0, 105.0, 99.0, 102.0, 10000
2023-01-02, 102.0, 107.0, 101.0, 105.0, 12000
...
```

## Code Explanation

### `app.py`

This is the main Flask application file. It handles file uploads, data preprocessing, model prediction, and rendering the HTML templates.

### `train.py`

This script handles data preprocessing, LSTM model training, and saving the trained model. It reads data from the `data/` directory, trains the LSTM model, and saves the model to the `models/` directory.

### `templates/index.html`

This HTML file contains the frontend of the web application. It includes forms for uploading data and displays the predicted stock prices.

### `static/`

This directory contains static files like CSS and JavaScript for styling the web application.
